# Overview

For this Module I wanted to further explore mobile app development and IOS development. 
Swift was an entirely new concept for me at the beginning of this module, but I wanted to familiarize
myself with it so that I begin creating the ideas I have for myself and see them come to life.

This app is a simple To-Do list application. At this time the user is able to access their daily to-do list,
add to their to-do list and alternate between those two pages.

I chose to make this application because I saw lots of oppurtutnity to learn about
the many different things I can do in Swift. I explored buttons, lists, images and many other 
things that didn't quite make it to the app yet.
