# Overview


For this project I pushed myself by taking on totally new concepts. I used my knowledge in other languages to create an app with React Native. I focused on using what I know to complete this project.

The purpose of this app was to create a shopping experience for users that is unique from other mobile app shopping. I wanted to create something that everyone could use, but take a different appraoch.

My purpose of creating this app is to prepare myself for future projects whether that is personal projects, school projects or projects in a futuer workplace. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
