# Overview

Creating this webpage was a way for me to explore and learn more about Javascript, CSS and HTML and the ways that they work together. Creating this webpage was for me to dive deeper into the different things those languages offer and to expand my knowledge on them

I created a very simple shopping website where the user can interact with more than one page with different options on each.

My purpose of writing this software was to use new techniques and try things I have never tried before when coding.
